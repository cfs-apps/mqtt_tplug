# jmsg_demo
Provides examples for using [JMSG_LIB](https://github.com/cfs-apps/jmsg_lib) Topic Plugins and [JMSG_MQTT](https://github.com/cfs-apps/jmsg_mqtt).  The Raspberry Pi Interface [RPI_INTF](https://github.com/cfs-apps/rpi_intf) app provides an example for using [JMSG_UDP](https://github.com/cfs-apps/jmsg_udp).

The _Remote Ops_ demo shows how an MQTT Broker can be used for command and telemetry communications. The _Space Steps_ demo communicates Space Step's [MQTT Receive](https://spacesteps.com/mqtt_receive) and [MQTT Send](https://spacesteps.com/mqtt_send) graphical web apps.

The Spacecarft Simulator [SC_SIM](https://github.com/cfs-apps/sc_sim) app uses a simple web page to communicate with JMSG_MQTT so users can remotely operate a simulated spacecraft.
